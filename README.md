# Excel_Project_Liverpool (in progress)

This project - my own research on English Premier League. 

Last 10 years gave us so much information and new parameters like xG, personal stats and tremendous pile of data for analysis.

- First step - to find a digital platform can give me ALL this information in a convenient, transform and “catchable” format. And it is fbref.com.

I just grabbed, transformed and loaded data from there to excel through Power Query.

First layer of our research will be just derivation average points by tours along championship. Simplest one, general but informative enough already.

All my route - from cleaning, filtering and merging relevant data to creation table with chart - BELOW!

- We can see two explicit descending periods that are conditioned by: 
 1. Start of tournament - time for adjusting new tactics and “injection” new players in the team
 2. Boxing Day period (end of December)- the busiest time by games with high intensity and competitiveness.

Second part of championship with continuous growth and falls - not stable results conditioned by traumas important players and fatigue. But usually no more than 1 game in a row lower than trend-line. 


## I have several purposes for analysis and I’ll show you results one by one later
