# Excel_Project_Liverpool (in progress)

This project - my own research on English Premier League. 

Last 10 years gave us so much information and new parameters like xG, personal stats and tremendous pile of data for analysis. 

## ep.01 
First step - to find a digital platform can give me ALL this information in a convenient, transform and “catchable” format. And it is fbref.com.

I just grabbed, transformed and loaded data from there to excel through Power Query.

## ep.02 

First layer of our research will be just derivation average points by tours along championship. Simplest one, general but informative enough already.

All my route - from cleaning, filtering and merging relevant data to creation table with chart - BELOW!

## ep.03

- We can see two explicit descending periods that are conditioned by: 
 1. Start of tournament - time for adjusting new tactics and “injection” new players in the team
 2. Boxing Day period (end of December)- the busiest time by games with high intensity and competitiveness.

Second part of championship with continuous growth and falls - not stable results conditioned by traumas important players and fatigue. But usually no more than 1 game in a row lower than trend-line. 


## I have several purposes for analysis and I’ll show you results one by one later
