# **Excel EPL Analysis Project** *(In Progress)*  

This project is my personal research on the **English Premier League (EPL)** using **Excel** and **Power Query**.  

Over the last decade, we've witnessed an explosion of football data—**xG (Expected Goals), player statistics, and countless other metrics**—providing an incredible opportunity for deep analysis.  

📊 **Objective:** Uncover meaningful insights from **10+ years of EPL data** by **collecting, transforming, and visualizing key trends**.

### **Step 1: Finding the Right Data Source**  
To conduct an effective analysis, I needed a **reliable and structured data source**. After exploring multiple platforms, I chose **[FBRef.com](https://fbref.com/)**, which provides detailed EPL statistics in an accessible format.  

### **Step 2: Extracting & Transforming Data**  
Using **Power Query**, I:  
✅ Pulled raw data from **FBRef.com**  
✅ Cleaned, structured, and transformed the dataset  
✅ Loaded it into **Excel** for further analysis

The **first layer of analysis** explores the **average points per matchweek** throughout the season—a **simple yet insightful** metric for understanding trends across the league.  

📈 **Process:**  
- Filtered, cleaned, and merged relevant data  
- Created **summary tables** and **charts** to visualize key patterns

## **Episode 3: Identifying Key Trends**  

### **Seasonal Performance Patterns**  

📌 Analysis of **10+ years of EPL data** reveals two **distinct declining trends**:  

1️⃣ **Season Kickoff** – Teams take time to adapt, implement tactics, and integrate new signings.  
2️⃣ **Boxing Day Period (December)** – The most **intense** stretch of the season, leading to fatigue and unpredictable results.  

⚡ **Post-December Recovery:**  
- The **second half of the season** sees **more stable performances**, though injuries and fatigue influence short-term dips.  
- Typically, teams **don’t drop more than one game below trend** unless impacted by significant injuries.

✅ Merging data from **9 different tables**  
✅ Connecting by **matchweek** and **team**  
✅ Cleaning and structuring the dataset  
✅ Sorting for better analysis  

📊 **Final dataset:** **64 columns** of detailed and exhaustive EPL data.
