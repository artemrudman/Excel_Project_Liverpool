# Excel_Project_Liverpool (in progress)

This project - my own research on English Premier League. 

Last 10 years gave us so much information and new parameters like xG, personal stats and tremendous pile of data for analysis. 

## ep.01 
step - to find a digital platform can give me ALL this information in a convenient, transform and “catchable” format. And it is fbref.com.

I just grabbed, transformed and loaded data from there to excel through Power Query.




I have several purposes for analysis and I’ll show you results one by one later
